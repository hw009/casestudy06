         <h2>About Us</h2>
         <p>Where clay meets woodworking Clayroom, Clayroom builds on the foundation of fostering creativity in our community by expanding into woodworking. The space is the union of a ceramic and a woodworking studio meant to inspire and bring us closer to the nature of physical making through multiple mediums. From throwing on the wheel to turning on the lathe, Clayroom, SoMa offers a haven for exploration around the craft of working with various elements. Come and join us through one of our classes or a membership and discover making. Clayroom Studio is now open</p>
